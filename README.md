# Action 3 Camera Streaming via Raspberry Pi and VS Code SSH

This repository documents the setup for streaming video from the **DJI Osmo Action 3 Camera** connected to a **Raspberry Pi**, and receiving the stream on a **personal computer** using Python and OpenCV.

The system connects over a shared Wi-Fi network (`Kira`), with the Raspberry Pi accessed via **VS Code SSH**. The Action 3 Camera is used in **Webcam Mode** and streams video via **FFmpeg**.
